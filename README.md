# Data-Visualization
Suggesting the Transportation Safety Board of Canada for where should efforts be focused to improve the safety of Canadian air space based on the data of last 25 years.

At first I have shown wrhich type of aircraft is causing the most number of accidents in Canada.

Then I have displayed through a heat map that in which areas that aircraft is causing most accidents.

Then I have shown the main causes, models and manufactures that are responsible for most accidents in Canada.

Finally a geopandas plot have been made to the damages that the accident have brought with them to the provinces in Canada for the past 25 years.

For the project, I have used Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas as well as interactibe flicker and button.
