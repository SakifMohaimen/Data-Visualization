# Data-Visualization
Suggesting the Transportation Safety Board of Canada for where should efforts be focused to improve the safety of Canadian air space based on the data of the last 25 years.

The visualizations can be seen in the 4 visualizations.pdf file.

At first, I have shown which type of aircraft is causing the most number of accidents in Canada.

Then I displayed through a heat map in which areas that aircraft is causing most accidents.

Then I have shown the main causes, models, and manufacturers that are responsible for most accidents in Canada.

Finally, a geopandas plot has been made to the damages that the accident has brought with them to the provinces in Canada for the past 25 years.

For the project, I have used Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Geopandas as well as interactive Flicker and Button.
